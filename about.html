    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2015, CIVIL+INTERIOR began as a small team of passionate engineers and designers with a vision to bridge the gap between construction and interior design. We believed that these two disciplines should work in harmony to create spaces that are not only structurally sound but also aesthetically pleasing and functional.</p>
    <p>Over the years, we have grown into a full-service firm with a reputation for excellence, innovation, and client satisfaction. Our integrated approach allows us to deliver cohesive projects where every element works together seamlessly.</p>
